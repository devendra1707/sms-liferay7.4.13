<p>A <a href="https://dev.liferay.com/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/liferay-workspace">Liferay Workspace</a>
is a generated environment that is built to hold and manage your Liferay
projects. It is intended to aid in the management of Liferay projects by
providing various build scripts and configured properties.</p>
<p>Liferay Workspace is the recommended environment for your code migration;
therefore, it will be the assumed development environment in this section.</p>
<p>Continue on to set up a workspace.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-liferay-workspace"><a href="#setting-up-liferay-workspace" id="setting-up-liferay-workspace">Setting Up Liferay Workspace</a></h2>
<p>You must set up your workspace development environment before you begin
upgrading your custom apps. If you don&rsquo;t have an existing workspace, follow the
step for creating one. If you have an existing workspace, follow the step on
importing it into the Upgrade Planner.</p>
<h3 id="creating-new-liferay-workspace"><a href="#creating-new-liferay-workspace" id="creating-new-liferay-workspace">Creating New Liferay Workspace</a></h3>
<p>Initiating this step in the Upgrade Planner loads the Liferay Workspace
Project wizard.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Give your new workspace a name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose the build type (Gradle or Maven) you prefer for your workspace
environment and future Liferay projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Finish.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You now have a new Liferay Workspace available in the Upgrade Planner!</p>
<p>For more information on creating a Liferay Workspace outside the planner, see
the
<a href="https://dev.liferay.com/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/creating-a-liferay-workspace">Creating a Liferay Workspace</a>
section.</p>
<h3 id="importing-existing-liferay-workspace"><a href="#importing-existing-liferay-workspace" id="importing-existing-liferay-workspace">Importing Existing Liferay Workspace</a></h3>
<p>If you already have an existing 7.x Liferay Workspace, you should import it
into the planner. Once you initiate this step, you&rsquo;re given a File
Explorer/Manager to select your existing workspace. After selecting it, the
workspace is imported into the Project Explorer.</p>
<p>For more information importing a workspace into your IDE, see
<a href="https://dev.liferay.com/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/importing-projects-in-dev-studio">this article</a>.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-liferay-workspace-settings"><a href="#configuring-liferay-workspace-settings" id="configuring-liferay-workspace-settings">Configuring Liferay Workspace Settings</a></h2>
<p>You must configure your workspace with the Liferay DXP version you intend to
upgrade to.</p>
<h3 id="configure-workspace-product-key"><a href="#configure-workspace-product-key" id="configure-workspace-product-key">Configure Workspace Product Key</a></h3>
<p>Configure your workspace by setting a product key. This automatically sets the Target Platform version, Docker image name, bundle URL, and other default settings for the Liferay DXP release.</p>
<h3 id="initializing-server-bundle"><a href="#initializing-server-bundle" id="initializing-server-bundle">Initializing Server Bundle</a></h3>
<p>Once your workspace is configured for the Liferay DXP version you&rsquo;re upgrading to,
you can initialize the server bundle. This involves downloading the bundle and
extracting it into its folder (e.g., <code>bundles</code>). If you have an existing
workspace already equipped with an older Liferay bundle, this deletes the old
bundle and initializes the new one.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re upgrading your code manually and working in Dev Studio, you can do
this by right-clicking the workspace project and selecting <em>Liferay</em> â†’
<em>Initialize Server Bundle</em>. See the
<a href="https://dev.liferay.com/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/installing-a-server-in-intellij">Installing a Server in IntelliJ</a>
article if you use IntelliJ instead. Visit the
<a href="https://dev.liferay.com/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/managing-your-liferay-server-with-blade-cli">Managing Your Liferay Server with Blade CLI</a>
article for information on how to do this via the command line.</p>
<h3 id="migrate-cfg-files-to-config-files"><a href="#migrate-cfg-files-to-config-files" id="migrate-cfg-files-to-config-files">Migrate .cfg Files to .config Files</a></h3>
<p><code>.config</code> files are preferred over <code>.cfg</code> files because they allow specifying a property value&rsquo;s type, and allow multi-valued properties.</p>
