<p>Getting a portlet JSP hook running on the new DXP version takes two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adapt your code to the new DXP version&rsquo;s API using the Liferay Upgrade Planner. When
you ran the planner&rsquo;s <em>Fix Upgrade Problems</em> step, many of the existing
issues were autocorrected/flagged. For any remaining errors, consult the
<a href="../05-fixing-upgrade-problems/02-resolving-a-projects-dependencies.html">Resolving a Project&rsquo;s Dependencies</a>
article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deploy your hook plugin.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Liferay DXP&rsquo;s Plugin Compatibility Layer converts the plugin WAR to a Web
Application Bundle (WAB) and installs it to Liferay&rsquo;s OSGi Runtime.</p>
<p>Although you can upgrade your portlet JSP hook to the new DXP version, there are
better ways to override a portlet JSP. The two recommended approaches are</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic includes</li>
<li>Portlet filters</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on recommended ways of customizing JSPs in the new DXP version,
